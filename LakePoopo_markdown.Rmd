## geographical conditions

- Lake Poopó, located in the Bolivian Altiplano
- extremely regulated by environmental influences
- mean elevation of 3810 m above sea level
- characterized by extreme spatial and temporal fluctuations in water resources and levels
- The Desaguadero River transports water from Lake Titicaca to Lake Poopó over 300 km
- declared dry in 2015 but still fills periodically with water
- largest dimensions of the Lake Poopó during the rainy season can be 3,000 km² with a maximum depth of 3.5 meters
- In the dry season often no water in the lake, which leads to a superficial salt crust
